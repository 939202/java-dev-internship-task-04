# Java Developer Internship – Task 4

## 📌 Task Title  
Method Design & Modular Calculator

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To build a modular calculator application in Java that demonstrates:
- Method design
- Method overloading
- Reusable utility methods
- Return values
- Pass-by-value behavior
- Exception handling
- Clean and modular code structure

---

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- Java (JDK)
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- GitHub

---

## 📂 Project Description  

This project is a console-based calculator application where:
- Each arithmetic operation is implemented as a separate method.
- Method overloading is demonstrated using `add()` with different parameter types.
- Utility methods are used to avoid code duplication.
- Java pass-by-value behavior is shown using a sample method.
- Division by zero is handled using exception handling.
